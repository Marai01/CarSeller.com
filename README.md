# CarSeller.com

### This project I've created was solely focused on the backend, which is why there's almost no styling. Now, what I wanted to have was a car buying and selling website with a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality and with features like admin pages and a database that's not susceptible to SQL injections.

# How to run:
### Make a database with the provided cars.sql code, then run the index.php on your computer/laptop with localhost, or any other method to locally run files.

# TechStack
### PHP, HTML, CSS, SQL, Javascript
